***Project Overview***

This project serves as a practical demonstration of data analysis and forensic investigation using Structured Query Language (SQL). The objective was to solve a fictional homicide—The TechNova CEO Case—by analyzing a series of interconnected database tables, proving the killer's guilt solely through their digital footprint.

Killer Identified: David Kumar

***🎯 Methodology: The Digital Detective***

The investigation was conducted in six logical steps, focusing on finding inconsistencies between physical access logs, communication records, and the suspect's self-reported alibi.

The primary technique involved using JOIN operations to link seemingly unrelated records across the following tables:

keycard_logs

alibis

calls

employees

evidence

**🔑 Key Findings (The Contradictions)**

The case was solved by proving three critical contradictions in the killer's digital data:

False Alibi: The suspect's statement was directly contradicted by the time-stamped keycard access logs placing them at the crime scene.

Scene Communication: A phone call was made during the exact 10-minute window the suspect was logged inside the CEO's office.

Physical Corroboration: The keycard log anomalies and physical evidence (fingerprints) found at the scene matched the digital timeline.

Thank you for viewing this data analysis capstone project.
